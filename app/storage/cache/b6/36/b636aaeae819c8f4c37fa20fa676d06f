Ned Kynaston is the assumedly gay cross-dressing actor who has been playing female parts in plays for years, particularly Desdemona in Othello, he also has a close relationship with a member of the Royal Court, the Duke of Buckingham. One day however, the rules of only men playing women could change when aspiring actress Maria auditions as Kynaston's praised role, Desdemona, and soon enough, King Charles II decides to make the law that all female roles should be played only by women. Maria becomes a star, while Ned finds himself out of work. But after a while, Ned finds it in his nature to forgive Maria's aspiration, they may even fall in love, and Charles may proclaim women will be played by either gender.";s:5:"genre";s:5:"Drama";s:4:"type";s:5:"movie";}i:1;O:8:"stdClass":6:{s:2:"id";s:5:"85010";s:5:"title";s:20:"Beauty and the Beast";s:6:"poster";N;s:4:"plot";N;s:5:"genre";N;s:4:"type";s:6:"series";}i:2;O:8:"stdClass":6:{s:2:"id";s:3:"809";s:5:"title";s:20:"Beauty and the Beast";s:6:"poster";s:62:"http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w342/b9QJr2oblOu1grgOMUZF1xkUJdh.jpg";s:4:"plot";N;s:5:"genre";N;s:4:"type";s:5:"movie";}i:3;O:8:"stdClass":6:{s:2:"id";s:4:"5002";s:5:"title";s:15:"Sleeping Beauty";s:6:"poster";s:62:"http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w342/kTJdhxuJ9in9ftpHqeCj85du29H.jpg";s:4:"plot";N;s:5:"genre";N;s:4:"type";s:5:"movie";}i:4;O:8:"stdClass":6:{s:2:"id";s:4:"9459";s:5:"title";s:15:"Beauty Brothers";s:6:"poster";s:62:"http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w342/sN2avEbsmWjbSMkv0FrcdAdegSk.jpg";s:4:"plot";N;s:5:"genre";N;s:4:"type";s:5:"movie";}i:5;O:8:"stdClass":6:{s:2:"id";s:5:"10085";s:5:"title";s:19:"Schemes of a Beauty";s:6:"poster";s:62:"http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w342/7BzpSHBk74v0WX9I9dFU1Lso0c1.jpg";s:4:"plot";N;s:5:"genre";N;s:4:"type";s:6:"series";}i:6;O:8:"stdClass":6:{s:2:"id";s:5:"58960";s:5:"title";s:22:"Fighting Beauty Wulong";s:6:"poster";s:62:"http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w342/ambloZ05EjyeV4SrGydPFGLR3mU.jpg";s:4:"plot";N;s:5:"genre";N;s:4:"type";s:6:"series";}i:7;O:8:"stdClass":6:{s:2:"id";s:5:"79804";s:5:"title";s:14:"War And Beauty";s:6:"poster";s:62:"http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w342/h39l7Xwk4LVeJvEm7OeYXkpomHY.jpg";s:4:"plot";N;s:5:"genre";N;s:4:"type";s:6:"series";}}
