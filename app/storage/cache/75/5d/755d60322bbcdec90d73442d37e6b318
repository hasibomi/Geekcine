Sensei no Ojikan was serialised in Bamboo Comics from 1997, published by Takeshobō. A 13 episode anime TV series adaptation was created by J.C.Staff. It was aired on TV Tokyo from April 4, 2004 to June 27, 2004, A 7 episode OVA, Sensei no Ojikan Gold, was also produced by J.C.Staff. These episodes were released onto the DVDs of the TV series, one episode for each DVD. Both the TV series and OVA were dubbed into English by The Ocean Group using their Blue Water Studios and have been licensed for release in North America by Geneon Entertainment. However, the OVA was folded onto the TV series and released together as simply Doki Doki School Hours. Thus, for the release in that region, the 14th episode is actually the first episode of the OVA and so on.

The series is centered on 27-year-old homeroom teacher Mika Suzuki and the eccentric and colorful students of her class. The anime, coming two years after J.C.Staff had success with Azumanga Daioh, inherits a lot stylistically from that series, however the original manga predates Azumanga Daioh by two years. Additionally, before the recent anime incarnation, the manga spawned a series of drama CDs.";s:5:"genre";s:17:"Animation, Comedy";s:4:"type";s:6:"series";}i:5;O:8:"stdClass":6:{s:2:"id";s:5:"83354";s:5:"title";s:14:"Without Limits";s:6:"poster";s:26:"imdb/posters/tt0119934.jpg";s:4:"plot";s:250:"The film follows the life of famous 1970s runner Steve Prefontaine from his youth days in Oregon to the University of Oregon where he worked with the legendary coach Bill Bowerman, later to Olympics in Munich and his early death at 24 in a car crash.";s:5:"genre";s:21:"Biography,Drama,Sport";s:4:"type";s:5:"movie";}i:6;O:8:"stdClass":6:{s:2:"id";s:3:"963";s:5:"title";s:16:"The Darkest Hour";s:6:"poster";s:62:"http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w342/ytnwAYZMalM2I0KlRFzj9R4X65U.jpg";s:4:"plot";N;s:5:"genre";N;s:4:"type";s:5:"movie";}i:7;O:8:"stdClass":6:{s:2:"id";s:5:"40404";s:5:"title";s:20:"Mahou Sensei Negima!";s:6:"poster";N;s:4:"plot";s:0:"";s:5:"genre";N;s:4:"type";s:6:"series";}}
