The half-hour long show premiered on July 21, 1996, and was hosted by Craig Kilborn until December 1998. Jon Stewart took over as host in January 1999, making the show more strongly focused on politics and the national media, in contrast with the pop culture focus during Kilborn's tenure. It is currently the longest-running program on Comedy Central, and has won 18 Primetime Emmy Awards.

Describing itself as a fake news program, The Daily Show draws its comedy and satire from recent news stories, political figures, media organizations, and often, aspects of the show itself. The show typically opens with a long monologue from Jon Stewart relating to recent headlines and frequently features exchanges with one or more of several correspondents, who adopt absurd or humorously exaggerated takes on current events against Stewart's straight man persona. The final segment is devoted to a celebrity interview, with guests ranging from actors and musicians to nonfiction authors and political figures.";s:5:"genre";s:12:"Comedy, News";s:4:"type";s:6:"series";}i:1;O:8:"stdClass":6:{s:2:"id";s:4:"3435";s:5:"title";s:15:"The Daily Habit";s:6:"poster";N;s:4:"plot";N;s:5:"genre";N;s:4:"type";s:6:"series";}i:2;O:8:"stdClass":6:{s:2:"id";s:5:"10766";s:5:"title";s:14:"The Daily Line";s:6:"poster";N;s:4:"plot";N;s:5:"genre";N;s:4:"type";s:6:"series";}i:3;O:8:"stdClass":6:{s:2:"id";s:5:"72725";s:5:"title";s:14:"The Daily Buzz";s:6:"poster";N;s:4:"plot";N;s:5:"genre";N;s:4:"type";s:6:"series";}i:4;O:8:"stdClass":6:{s:2:"id";s:5:"38967";s:5:"title";s:12:"The Daily 10";s:6:"poster";N;s:4:"plot";N;s:5:"genre";N;s:4:"type";s:6:"series";}i:5;O:8:"stdClass":6:{s:2:"id";s:5:"78911";s:5:"title";s:35:"The Daily Show (Nederlandse editie)";s:6:"poster";N;s:4:"plot";N;s:5:"genre";N;s:4:"type";s:6:"series";}i:6;O:8:"stdClass":6:{s:2:"id";s:5:"79246";s:5:"title";s:14:"The Daily Show";s:6:"poster";N;s:4:"plot";N;s:5:"genre";N;s:4:"type";s:6:"series";}i:7;O:8:"stdClass":6:{s:2:"id";s:5:"82485";s:5:"title";s:31:"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart";s:6:"poster";N;s:4:"plot";N;s:5:"genre";N;s:4:"type";s:6:"series";}}
