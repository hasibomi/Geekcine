It featured a production team led by director Shinichirō Watanabe, character designer Kazuto Nakazawa and mechanical designer Mahiro Maeda. Samurai Champloo was Watanabe's first directorial effort for an anime television series after the critically acclaimed Cowboy Bebop. It was broadcast in Japan on Fuji TV on May 20, 2004 and ran for twenty-six episodes until its conclusion on March 19, 2005.

The story is set during a fictional version of Japan in the Edo period with an anachronistic, predominantly hip-hop, setting. It follows Mugen, an impudent and freedom-loving vagrant swordsman; Jin, a cool-headed and stoical ronin; and Fuu, a brave young girl who asks them to accompany her in her quest across Japan to find the "samurai who smells of sunflowers".

Samurai Champloo was critically acclaimed, and the series was dubbed in the English language and licensed by Geneon Entertainment for releases in North America. Funimation Entertainment began licensing the series after Geneon ceased production of its titles. It was also licensed for English releases in the United Kingdom by MVM Films, and in Australia and New Zealand by Madman Entertainment.";s:5:"genre";s:29:"Animation, Action & Adventure";s:4:"type";s:6:"series";}i:1;O:8:"stdClass":6:{s:2:"id";s:5:"37468";s:5:"title";s:17:"Shamanic Princess";s:6:"poster";s:62:"http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w342/bz75GmxUH85uRQDUFK6hXV62sRZ.jpg";s:4:"plot";N;s:5:"genre";N;s:4:"type";s:6:"series";}i:2;O:8:"stdClass":6:{s:2:"id";s:4:"1128";s:5:"title";s:30:"Graham Norton's Bigger Picture";s:6:"poster";s:62:"http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w342/slM1aVVsYrroIrU28eqkPFKiYOf.jpg";s:4:"plot";N;s:5:"genre";N;s:4:"type";s:6:"series";}i:3;O:8:"stdClass":6:{s:2:"id";s:5:"38912";s:5:"title";s:35:"Victoria Beckham: Coming to America";s:6:"poster";N;s:4:"plot";N;s:5:"genre";N;s:4:"type";s:6:"series";}i:4;O:8:"stdClass":6:{s:2:"id";s:5:"55552";s:5:"title";s:24:"La Malédiction d'Arkham";s:6:"poster";s:62:"http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w342/xZJRKY4pL63kj5lSTameyVGGI12.jpg";s:4:"plot";N;s:5:"genre";N;s:4:"type";s:5:"movie";}i:5;O:8:"stdClass":6:{s:2:"id";s:5:"78081";s:5:"title";s:15:"Yokohama Shinju";s:6:"poster";N;s:4:"plot";N;s:5:"genre";N;s:4:"type";s:6:"series";}i:6;O:8:"stdClass":6:{s:2:"id";s:5:"78082";s:5:"title";s:35:"Intercontinental Poker Championship";s:6:"poster";N;s:4:"plot";N;s:5:"genre";N;s:4:"type";s:6:"series";}i:7;O:8:"stdClass":6:{s:2:"id";s:5:"51971";s:5:"title";s:12:"Ezham Suryan";s:6:"poster";s:62:"http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w342/y7OHSCOZkvVsbIviks7dpARNQa0.jpg";s:4:"plot";N;s:5:"genre";N;s:4:"type";s:5:"movie";}}
